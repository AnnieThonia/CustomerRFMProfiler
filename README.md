# RFM-Analysis-_Customer-Segmentation-and-Profiling
RFM analysis condenses customer information based on their recent purchase, frequency of purchases, and expenditures. This assists businesses in making informed decisions to enhance customer relationships and boost revenue within different customer segments.

1. Recency (R): This measures how recently a customer made a purchase, with more recent purchases receiving higher scores.
2. Frequency (F): It assesses how often a customer makes purchases, with more frequent buyers getting higher scores.
3. Monetary Value (M): This evaluates how much money a customer spends on purchases, giving higher scores to those who spend more.

The Analysis was conducted using an Excel spreadsheet.
