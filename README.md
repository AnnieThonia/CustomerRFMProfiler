# RFM-Analysis-_Customer-Segmentation-and-Profiling

"The CustomerRFMProfiler repository focuses on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value) analysis to condense customer information based on their recent purchases, frequency of purchases, and expenditures. The analysis, conducted using an Excel spreadsheet, aims to enhance customer relationships and boost revenue within different customer segments by providing businesses with valuable insights. The RFM metrics are defined as follows:

Recency Â®: Measures how recently a customer made a purchase, with more recent purchases receiving higher scores.
Frequency (F): Assesses how often a customer makes purchases, with more frequent buyers getting higher scores.
Monetary Value (M): Evaluates how much money a customer spends on purchases, giving higher scores to those who spend more."
